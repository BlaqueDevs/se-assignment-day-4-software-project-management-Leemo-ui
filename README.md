# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery avoids cost overruns and ensures market readiness. Managers can use clear planning, Agile methods, project management tools, and regular progress tracking
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control ensures financial viability. Strategies include accurate cost estimation, expense monitoring, scope management, and cost-efficient tools.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile: Flexible, iterative, allows feedback; Cons: Less predictable.
Waterfall: Structured, well-documented; Cons: Rigid, hard to change.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile suits dynamic projects (e.g., mobile apps), while Waterfall is best for fixed-scope projects (e.g., government contracts).
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Use automated testing, manual testing, code reviews, and CI/CD to maintain high standards.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Clear scope prevents scope creep. WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) organizes tasks for better management.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
